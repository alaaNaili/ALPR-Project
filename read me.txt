* Project Description:

Automatic License Plate Recognition System using Deep Learning
This project implements an end-to-end Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system capable of detecting and recognizing Chinese and English license plates. The system uses a two-stage pipeline: YOLOv8 for real-time license plate detection and EasyOCR for character recognition. Trained on a combined dataset of over 41,000 images from CCPD2019 and Kaggle ALPR datasets, the system achieves robust performance across various challenging conditions including different lighting, angles, and weather conditions. The solution includes a user-friendly web interface built with Gradio, making it accessible for real-world applications such as parking management, traffic monitoring, and automated toll collection.


Phase 1: Data Collection & Exploration
What we did:

-Downloaded two major datasets:
	*CCPD2019: ~340,000 Chinese license plate images
	*Kaggle ALPR: 21,161 annotated images
-Created dataset_manager.py to explore and visualize the datasets
-Created explore_alpr_labels.py to understand annotation formats

***
Phase 2: Data Processing & Unification
What we did:

Created ccpd_parser.py to decode CCPD filenames (they encode bbox, plate number, brightness, blur, etc.)
Built dataset_converter.py to merge both datasets into unified YOLO format
Created train/val/test splits with proper structure

***
Phase 3: Configuration & Setup
What we did:

Created centralized configuration file for all project settings
Set up training parameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate,etc.)
Configured paths and model settings

***
Phase 4: Detection Model Training
What we did:

Trained YOLOv8 (nano version) for license plate detection
Used 50 epochs, batch size 16
Applied data augmentation (flips, scaling, color adjustments)
Monitored training with validation metrics

***
Phase 5: Complete ALPR Pipeline
What we did:

Integrated YOLOv8 detector with EasyOCR for text recognition
Created preprocessing pipeline for better OCR accuracy
Built end-to-end system: Image → Detection → Cropping → Recognition → Results

Pipeline flow:

1-Load image
2-Detect license plates (YOLOv8)
3-Crop detected regions with padding
4-Preprocess crops (grayscale, denoise, enhance contrast)
5-Recognize text (EasyOCR - Chinese + English)
6-Return results with confidence scores

Outcome: Working end-to-end ALPR system

***
Phase 6: Web Interface
What we did:

Created interactive web application using Gradio
Users can upload images and get instant results
Displays annotated images with bounding boxes and recognized text
Shows confidence scores for both detection and recognition

Features:

-Drag-and-drop image upload
-Real-time processing
-Visual results with bounding boxes
-Sample images for quick testing
-Confidence scores display
